# ðŸŒŒ 3I/ATLAS Live Tracker

**Real-time 3D visualization of the third confirmed interstellar object in our solar system.**

This project visualizes **3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1)** along with previous interstellar objects like 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov in a fully interactive, mobile-friendly 3D scene using **Three.js**. Users can view hyperbolic orbits, toggle Earth portal perspective, and explore live object data.

## Features

- **3D Real-Time Visualization**: Smooth rendering of the interstellar object and planets in the solar system.
- **Earth Portal View**: Toggle camera to orbit near Earth while tracking the object.
- **Orbit Path Toggle**: Show or hide orbital trajectories of objects.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust simulation speed (1x, 5x, 10x, 30x).
- **Labels Toggle**: Show or hide labels on planets and objects.
- **Interactive Controls**: OrbitControls for drag, zoom, and pan (works on mobile and desktop).
- **Live Info Panel**: Displays distance from Sun and Earth, velocity, phase (approaching/receding), and observations.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully mobile-friendly with touch-friendly controls.
- **Alert Banner**: Highlights active tracking status.
- **Fact Boxes**: Additional scientific insights and observations.
